##PYG##

Just a quick set of code for Python which outlines the typical requested answer for the first "real" question people find when learning the language.

It solves for a word being passed which, when starting with a consonant will move that opening letter to the back of the word & append the pig latin end string. If the letter is a vowel, it'll just append the pig latin string.
